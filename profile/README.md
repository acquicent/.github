## Hi there 👋

To our deep regret, Acquicent went to heaven in December 2024. We'd like to think it's up there somewhere,
frolicking about with other failed startups, looking down on us not with sadness or regret, but with warmth
and gratitude.

"Don't be sad it's over; be thankful it happened."

You can reach me (Anthony, Acquicent's founder) through [my personal website](https://citrano.com).
