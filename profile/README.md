## Hello friends 👋

To our deep regret, Acquicent went to heaven in December 2024. We'd like to think it's up there somewhere,
frolicking about with other failed startups, looking down on us not with sadness or regret, but with love, warmth,
and gratitude.

“Don't be sad it's over; be thankful it happened.”

You can reach me (Anthony, Acquicent's founder) through [my personal website](https://citrano.com).

Take care of yourselves, and never be afraid to give something a shot while you can. Life is ridiculously short.
